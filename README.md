Xarcade2Joystick
================

_Xarcade2Jstick_ exclusively captures the keyboard events of the __Xarcade Tankstick__ and maps these events to corresponding events on two virtual game pad devices.

_Xarcade2Jstick_ was originally written as a supplementary tool for the [RetroPie Project](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/). Using this tool allows the usage of the auto-config capability of [RetroArch](http://themaister.net/retroarch.html), a central component of a RetroPie installation.

## Usage

Your Xarcade will appear as two gamepads and can be used accordingly. There are also some special combinations of buttons that have special meaning:

The select buttons are the front buttons on each side of the joystick. The start buttons are the white top-center buttons.
